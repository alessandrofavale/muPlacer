# Simulations
`sim_app_size.py`
high connected service graph with Barabasi algorithm with 1 parent. Analysis varying the number of micorservices from 10 to 200. The objective is to reduce the delay with respect to the cloud one of 30 ms. Result in `res1.mat` file.

`sim_app_size2.py`
high connected service graph with Barabasi algorithm with 2 parents. Analysis varying the number of micorservices from 10 to 200. The objective is to reduce the delay with respect to the cloud one of 30 ms. Result in `res2.mat` file.

`sim_app_size3.py`
high centralized service graph with Barabasi algorithm with 1 parents. Analysis varying the number of micorservices from 10 to 200. The objective is to reduce the delay with respect to the cloud one of 30 ms. Result in `res3.mat` file.
